## Two-Tier ERP Deployment

### Best practices for Two-Tier ERP

- Functionality Requirements by Subsidiary

- Interdependencies Documented

- Inter-company Transactions Defined Early

- Reporting Considerations and aggregation

A single system of record is maintained that is responsible for the higher order functions of the ERP systems. This in turn frees up the Tier 2 ERP deployments for localization and specialized processes.

This also had additional benefits when the business engages in significant M&A Activity or planned divestiture

### Headquarter and Subsidiary

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from the subsidiaries

- Subsidiaries all run SAP Public Cloud and have standardized data architecture

- Customization is pushed to the aggregating ERP system

### Central Services/Shared Services

- Financial System is a separate legal entity

- Similar to HQ and Subsidiary but the business units/sites have autonomy to run whatever system they choose

### Supply Chain Ecosystem

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from a single cloud instance

- Cloud system is offered to vendors and partners, can be tailored to hyper-automated tasks at low risk to the continuity of the business
