## SAP S/4HANA Cloud Deployment

- Public (Multi-tenant server)
  
  - Lowest cost, scaleable
  
  - Hinges on reliability

- Private (Private management of server e.g. SAP Datacenter)
  
  - Secure as you make it
  
  - Costly to scale
  
  - Most applicable in sensitive industries

- Hybrid
  
  - Blended use of private datacenters and on-prem
  
  - More scalable than on-prem only
  
  - Security can vary depending on cloud provider still

## Services

- Database
  
  - In-memory computing engine favors memory on the user's machine for resources
  
  - Column-oriented database (vs row-oriented)

- Core Data Services
  
  - Domain-specific language collection that prepares views
  
  - CDS views are intended to consumed (e.g. by a UI, analytics platform, or other systems)

## SAP Fiori Launchpad

- Cross-platform (Mobile and Desktop)

- User Personalization of their assigned applications

- Role-specific configurations

## Two-Tier ERP Deployment

### Best practices for Two-Tier ERP

- Functionality Requirements by Subsidiary

- Interdependencies Documented

- Inter-company Transactions Defined Early

- Reporting Considerations and aggregation

![](https://learning.sap.com/service/media/topic/fe99ef3b-60f7-49e4-a782-595ab9aa5dff/S4CP01_27_en-US_media/S4CP01_27_en-US_images/2Tier%20Intro.png)

A single system of record is maintained that is responsible for the higher order functions of the ERP systems. This in turn frees up the Tier 2 ERP deployments for localization and specialized processes.

This also had additional benefits when the business engages in significant M&A Activity or planned divestiture 

![](https://learning.sap.com/service/media/topic/fe99ef3b-60f7-49e4-a782-595ab9aa5dff/S4CP01_27_en-US_media/S4CP01_27_en-US_images/2Tier%20Scenarios.png)

### Headquarter and Subsidiary

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from the subsidiaries

- Subsidiaries all run SAP Public Cloud and have standardized data architecture

- Customization is pushed to the aggregating ERP system

### Central Services/Shared Services

- Financial System is a separate legal entity

- Similar to HQ and Subsidiary but the business units/sites have autonomy to run whatever system they choose

### Supply Chain Ecosystem

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from a single cloud instance

- Cloud system is offered to vendors and partners, can be tailored to hyper-automated tasks at low risk to the continuity of the business

### CPEA Credits

Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement(CPEA) credits are used to consume BTP services.

Credits have a baseline free value that is meant to allow customers to demo the BTP without commitment. Additional Credits can be purchased(Imagine that, they want your money!). Credits allow for demo usage of the BTP services without a firmed license.

CPEA Licensing is a commitment to buy the credits for the duration of the contract. There's an annual commitment contract for the BTP services

The Activate methodology is SAP's framework for implementation success. This is a canned set of project phases, tasks, and deliverables that will serve as guard rails and goalposts for the implementation team inside the business.

The Roadmap Viewer is structured with the following elements

- **Phases**: stages of the project, including Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, and Run. At the end of each phase, a quality gate exists to verify the completion of the deliverables.
- **Deliverables**: outcomes that are delivered during the course of the project. Several deliverables are included within a phase.
- **Task**: work to be performed. One or several tasks comprise a deliverable.
- **Workstream**: a collection of related deliverables that show time relationships within a project and among other streams. Streams can span phases and are not necessarily dependent on phase starts and end.
- **Accelerators**: provide assistance in the form of How-to guides, Best Practice recommendations, prescribed templates, and links to learning materials. Accelerators can be linked to Phases, Deliverables or Tasks.

### [SAP Best Practices]([SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/))
