## SAP S/4HANA Cloud Deployment

- Public (Multi-tenant server)
  
  - Lowest cost, scaleable
  
  - Hinges on reliability

- Private (Private management of server e.g. SAP Datacenter)
  
  - Secure as you make it
  
  - Costly to scale
  
  - Most applicable in sensitive industries

- Hybrid
  
  - Blended use of private datacenters and on-prem
  
  - More scalable than on-prem only
  
  - Security can vary depending on cloud provider still

## Services

- SaaS - Software as a Service
  
  - Software that is scalable (no need for new licenses etc. all inclusive)
  
  - Thin clients and web browsers lower hardware implementation costs across the business
  
  - Upgrades are handled by the vendor
  
  - SAP Offerings
    
    - SAP SuccessFactors (Human Capital Management)
    
    - SAP Fieldglass (Vendor Management System)
    
    - SAP Ariba (B2B Hub)
    
    - SAP Concur (T&E)

- PaaS - Platform as a Service
  
  - A la carte development environment maintained by the vendor
  
  - Services are optional and can be selected for a fee
  
  - SAP Business Technology Platform is the SAP offering

- IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
  
  - Vendor maintains the computing resources and provisions them to customers who are free to deploy and manage it
  
  - Maintains control over the development environment while outsourcing hardware costs and maintenance
  
  - SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC) is the SAP product for this vertical
    
    - Integrates with other Cloud Providers
    
    - Bring-your-own-license: Existing SAP customers can bring their existing deployments into the cloud

## SAP S/4HANA Architecture

- Â User Interface

- ERP Software

- Analytical Layer

- Database
  
  - In-memory computing engine favors memory on the user's machine for resources
  
  - Column-oriented database (vs row-oriented)

- Core Data Services
  
  - Domain-specific language collection that prepares views
  
  - CDS views are intended to consumed (e.g. by a UI, analytics platform, or other systems)

## SAP Fiori Launchpad

- Cross-platform (Mobile and Desktop)

- User Personalization of their assigned applications

- Role-specific configurations

[SAP Best Practices | SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Best_Practices)

## Two-Tier ERP Deployment

### Best practices for Two-Tier ERP

- Functionality Requirements by Subsidiary

- Interdependencies Documented

- Inter-company Transactions Defined Early

- Reporting Considerations and aggregation

![](https://learning.sap.com/service/media/topic/fe99ef3b-60f7-49e4-a782-595ab9aa5dff/S4CP01_27_en-US_media/S4CP01_27_en-US_images/2Tier%20Intro.png)

A single system of record is maintained that is responsible for the higher order functions of the ERP systems. This in turn frees up the Tier 2 ERP deployments for localization and specialized processes.

This also had additional benefits when the business engages in significant M&A Activity or planned divestiture 

![](https://learning.sap.com/service/media/topic/fe99ef3b-60f7-49e4-a782-595ab9aa5dff/S4CP01_27_en-US_media/S4CP01_27_en-US_images/2Tier%20Scenarios.png)

### Headquarter and Subsidiary

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from the subsidiaries

- Subsidiaries all run SAP Public Cloud and have standardized data architecture

- Customization is pushed to the aggregating ERP system

### Central Services/Shared Services

- Financial System is a separate legal entity

- Similar to HQ and Subsidiary but the business units/sites have autonomy to run whatever system they choose

### Supply Chain Ecosystem

- HQ runs a highly customized instance that is tailored to accept the data from a single cloud instance

- Cloud system is offered to vendors and partners, can be tailored to hyper-automated tasks at low risk to the continuity of the business

### CPEA Credits

Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement(CPEA) credits are used to consume BTP services.

Credits have a baseline free value that is meant to allow customers to demo the BTP without commitment. Additional Credits can be purchased(Imagine that, they want your money!). Credits allow for demo usage of the BTP services without a firmed license.

CPEA Licensing is a commitment to buy the credits for the duration of the contract. There's an annual commitment contract for the BTP services

The Activate methodology is SAP's framework for implementation success. This is a canned set of project phases, tasks, and deliverables that will serve as guard rails and goalposts for the implementation team inside the business.

The Roadmap Viewer is structured with the following elements

- **Phases**: stages of the project, including Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, and Run. At the end of each phase, a quality gate exists to verify the completion of the deliverables.
- **Deliverables**: outcomes that are delivered during the course of the project. Several deliverables are included within a phase.
- **Task**: work to be performed. One or several tasks comprise a deliverable.
- **Workstream**: a collection of related deliverables that show time relationships within a project and among other streams. Streams can span phases and are not necessarily dependent on phase starts and end.
- **Accelerators**: provide assistance in the form of How-to guides, Best Practice recommendations, prescribed templates, and links to learning materials. Accelerators can be linked to Phases, Deliverables or Tasks.

### [SAP Best Practices]([SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/))

SAP Central Business Configuration is the tool for managing a multi-system deployment. Handles provisioning for SAP Cloud edition as well as SaaS platforms(Ariba, Concur, SuccessFactors)

Consists of three Subject Areas

- Project Experience
  
  - Project management intake pipeline

- Scoping
  
  - Identifying the correct application of the SAP Best Practices guide to the project or the task

- Central Configuration
  
  - Serves as a staging ground for deployments

### 

## New Implementation

### Configuration Pathways for Private Cloud

- Activate Methodology with Best Practices (and Enterprise Management Layer if delegated during the sales pipeline)

- Implementation Guide(IMG) with Activate Methodology with Best Practices for task management

- Only IMG is used - this will involve the SPRO txn :shrug:

##### SAP Best Practices for Private Cloud

SAP Solution Builder is the tool for the deployment of SAP Best practices for Private Cloud customers 

Best Practice Scenarios are predefined process flows for the business that are deployed through the solution builder

Best practices are deployed to the development environment and then flow through to the test/quality system and production via "Transports"

##### Signavio for New Implementations

Signavio picks up where the Solution Builder left off and breaks out the selected deployment into tasks and deliverables while providing the Collaboration Hub as a space to work through the deployment.

##### Configuration Responsibilities

SAP Consultants are responsible for the questionnaire that is conducted as part of the sales pipeline

Client or Implementation Consultant is responsible for tasks and customization that is required for their deployment

### System Conversion for Legacy Systems

![](https://learning.sap.com/service/media/topic/fe5dc72a-216a-4a07-8cf2-3c8821358470/S4CP01_27_en-US_media/S4CP01_27_en-US_images/2105_U3_L2_03_ConfigSysConver_001.png)

SAP Consultants handle configurations of technical items like Client 000 (Admin Client) that cannot be prepared by the client

#### Client Responsibilities

- SAP Readiness Check

- Custom Code Optimization

- Integration Testing 

### Activate Methodology Steps for Conversions

#### Prepare Phase Tools

##### Simplification Item Catalog

Simplification Items are the steps needed to be taken for a conversion for the business and IT

##### SAP Readiness Check

Only for SAP ERP 6.0 Customers. Automated tool for high level, rough-cut specifications and compatibility considerations.

This is the first step in an SAP conversion.
Checks compatibility with SAP S/4HANA.
Creates the stack file that is used in the conversion which is a requirement for the Software Update Manager(SUM) tool

##### Simplification Item Check

These are the technical checks to  ensure that you can be converted. This is a mandatory step that is triggered by the System Update Manager(SUM) tool. Since SUM is required, this is required for all conversions.

##### Custom Code Migration

The Custom Code Migration Tool checks against a list of simplifications. This is not mandatory for the prepare phase

#### Realize Phase Tools

##### Software Update Manager(SUM)

The SUM manages the migration of mapped data and custom applications. For larger legacy systems the Silent Data Migration Infrastructure (SMDI)

### Fiori Launchpad Configuration for Private Cloud
